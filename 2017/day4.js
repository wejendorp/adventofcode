/*
--- Day 4: High-Entropy Passphrases ---

A new system policy has been put in place that requires all accounts to use a passphrase instead of simply a password. A passphrase consists of a series of words (lowercase letters) separated by spaces.

To ensure security, a valid passphrase must contain no duplicate words.

For example:

aa bb cc dd ee is valid.
aa bb cc dd aa is not valid - the word aa appears more than once.
aa bb cc dd aaa is valid - aa and aaa count as different words.
The system's full passphrase list is available as your puzzle input. How many passphrases are valid?
*/

const compute = s =>
	s.split('\n').filter(line => {
		const words = line.split(' ');
		const uniqueWords = new Set(words);
		return words.length === uniqueWords.size;
	}).length;

/*
--- Part Two ---

For added security, yet another system policy has been put in place. Now, a valid passphrase must contain no two words that are anagrams of each other - that is, a passphrase is invalid if any word's letters can be rearranged to form any other word in the passphrase.

For example:

abcde fghij is a valid passphrase.
abcde xyz ecdab is not valid - the letters from the third word can be rearranged to form the first word.
a ab abc abd abf abj is a valid passphrase, because all letters need to be used when forming another word.
iiii oiii ooii oooi oooo is valid.
oiii ioii iioi iiio is not valid - any of these words can be rearranged to form any other word.
Under this new system policy, how many passphrases are valid?

const compute2 = s =>
	s.split('\n').filter(line => {
		const words = line.split(' ').map(x =>
			x
				.split('')
				.sort()
				.join('')
		);
		const uniqueWords = new Set(words);
		return words.length === uniqueWords.size;
	}).length;

process.stdin.setEncoding('utf8');
process.stdin.on('readable', () => {
	var s = process.stdin.read();
	if (s) {
		console.log(compute(s.trim()));
		console.log(compute2(s.trim()));
	}
